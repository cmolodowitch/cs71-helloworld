# CSCI E-71 Set Up Your Development Environment: Python
## `helloworld.py` Notes
Since the specification for the program lists "Takes one command-line argument", I added a ValueError that's raised if there are no command-line arguments.

I also went with the "Optional Challenge" of modifying the `helloworld.py` script to handle multiple names.

## Screenshots
The `helloworld_execution.png` screenshot demonstrates the operation of my script, with 0, 1, and 3 command-line arguments.

To satisfy the "PyCharm Professional Installation" item in the Rubric, although it wasn't explicitly requested, I included an additional `pycharm_info.png` screenshot showing the "About PyCharm" dialog to demonstrate that I have PyCharm Pro installed with an educational license.
